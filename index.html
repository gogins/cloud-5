Gogins</a></h2>
<p>This is computer music that is hosted online, but actually rendered
in Web browsers. The pieces are not soundfiles and they are not
streamed. Each piece is a Web page that contains embedded software that
runs in the browser to synthesize the music. Most pieces will play
indefinitely. There may or may not be animated visuals along with the
music. The listener may or may not be able to control and/or customize
the piece &#x2013; perhaps quite a bit, amounting to a new piece, co-composed
with me.</p>

<p>The cloud-music pieces are implemented using my cloud-5 system for
creating computer music that runs in Web browsers. This in turn is based
on <a href="https://github.com/gogins/csound-wasm">my own WebAssembly
builds of Csound and CsoundAC</a>. Some pieces may use third party
libraries. The home page of Csound itself is
<a href="[xx](https://csound.com/)">here</a>.</p>
<p>Code written as part of cloud-5 is licensed under the terms of the
same license as Csound, the <a
href="https://github.com/csound/csound/blob/master/COPYING">GNU Lesser
Public License, version 2.1</a>. Components and libraries used by
cloud-5 come under a variety of open source licenses; see the links to
individual packages for more information.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The cloud-5 system is designed for making sophisticated computer
music purely in the HTML5 environment. The system is especially suited
for pieces that play online, for pieces that play indefinitely, for
visual music, for algorithmic composition, and for live coding.</p>
<p>cloud-5 runs on every system with an audio output that can run a Web
server and a standards compliant Web browser. That includes <em>all</em>
computers running macOS, Linux, or Windows, as well as most Android
devices.</p>
<p>For recent changes, see the <em><a href="#release-notes">Release
Notes</a></em> at the end of this document.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<h3 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>A Web server that will run from a configurable directory in which
you can read, edit, and write files. On most systems, the simplest way
to get a Web server is to install <a
href="https://www.python.org/">Python 3</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A standards-compliant Web browser (currently, that includes
nearly all Web browsers). Should already exist on your system. On
Android, install a Web server app such as <a
href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phlox.simpleserver">Phlox</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A text or code editor for writing your compositions. A simple
text editor should already exist on your system. I use <a
href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> myself, as
it is very powerful and yet easy to customize. On Android, install a
text editor such as <a
href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhmsoft.edit.pro">QuickEdit
Pro</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>There is no installation! Simply download the release, and unzip it
into a cloud-5 directory.</p>
<p>cloud-5 can be stored on a USB thumb drive, and will run with all
functionality <em>from</em> the thumb drive. This makes it possible to
carry all of your work in progress from computer to device to
computer.</p>
<p>Or, simply copy the entire cloud-5 directory with all contents to
your computer or device. Make sure you can execute, read, edit, and
write files in your cloud-5 directory.</p>
<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>There is no configuration!</p>
<p>Well, actually there might be one thing. You might need to configure
your local Web server to serve files from your cloud-5 directory.</p>
<h3 id="running">Running</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Start a local Web server to serve the cloud-5 directory. The
easiest way to do this on most systems is to open a terminal, change to
your cloud-5 directory, and execute
<code>python3 -m http.server</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Start your Web browser, and navigate to your cloud-5 Web site
(usually just something like <code>https://localhost:8000</code>). Some
users have problems with Firefox, e.g.&#xA0;with WebMIDI permissions. If you
experience this, try the Chrome browser.</p></li>
<li><p>You should see this README as a Web page. Click on <a
href="cloud_music_no_1.html">cloud_music_no_1.html</a> and verify that
you see animated graphics, and can play and hear the piece.</p></li>
<li><p>Some cloud-5 pieces use the dat.gui library to create a popup
menu of controls for Csound instruments or other purposes. You can
create new presets, and you can get the Web browser to remember the
current preset parameters in local storage. If you need to revert to the
hard-coded parameters in a piece, clear local storage in the browser
settings, or in the browser&#x2019;s debugger.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="making-music">Making Music</h2>
<p>In cloud-5, musical compositions are written as Web pages, i.e.&#xA0;as
.html files.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s a good idea for each composition to be written as just one .html
file. It must be in your cloud-5 directory. Any Csound orchestra code,
JavaScript code, and GLSL shader programs should simply be embedded in
the HTML file in, e.g., template strings (string literals) in JavaScript
code, or included as <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> or
<code>&lt;textview&gt;</code> elements.</p>
<p>There are many ways to write compositions, because the capabilities
of Csound, Strudel, and HTML5 are so vast. Start out by a making a copy
of one of the examples below, and edit it to suit your own purposes.</p>
<h3 id="tutorial-examples">Tutorial Examples</h3>
<p>These are pieces designed to show how to use the new architecture for
cloud-5 based on <code>cloud-5.js</code>, a library of resuable Web
components that greatly simplifies writing cloud music pieces.</p>

to the Strudel source code and distribution.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course, a standards-compliant Web browser, which has an
awesome set of capabilities, including the most widely used programming
language, JavaScript, which can call Csound, CsoundAC, and
Strudel.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="capabilities">Capabilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>High-resolution, sample-accurate sound synthesis using one of the
largest and most capable libraries that exists for synthesis and signal
processing, the <a
href="https://csound.com/docs/manual/index.html">Csound
opcodes</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Interactive live music coding using the domain-specific,
real-time music programming language Strudel; this includes a neat
animated piano roll display of currently playing notes in the
music.</p></li>
<li><p>Control of Csound from Strudel. This includes both real-time
notes generated by Strudel patches for the <code>csound</code> and
<code>csoundm</code> outputs, and real-time control channel values
created by Strudel Patterns, including the new <code>slider</code>
widget.</p></li>
<li><p>MIDI input and output from Csound and Strudel.</p></li>

Strudel.</p></li>
<li><p>Several systems for time-frequency analysis/synthesis, from
Csound, including Victor Lazzarini&#x2019;s <a
href="https://csound.com/docs/manual/SpectralRealTime.html">phase
vocoder streaming</a> (PVS) opcodes.</p></li>
<li><p>Several high-fidelity sample players, from Csound (<a
href="https://csound.com/docs/manual/SiggenSample.html#SiggenSampleSF">Fluidsynth
opcodes</a>) and Strudel (<a
href="https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel/tree/main/packages/superdough">superdough</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>High-resolution, three-dimensional, animated computer graphics
using WebGL and/or OpenGL Shader Language (GLSL), from the Web
browser.</p></li>
<li><p>All of the staggering panoply of capabilities that are built into
every standards-compliant Web browser, see <a
href="https://html5test.com/">HTML5 Test</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="running-in-the-browser">Running in the Browser</h2>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p>The major limitation of running in the browser is that csound-5
pieces are sandboxed, and can write files only to a temporary filesystem
inside the sandbox. It is not possible to write directly to the
filesystem on the user&#x2019;s computer.</p>
<p>However, it <em>is</em> possible to use an audio loopback driver such
as <a href="https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole">BlackHole</a>
to route audio produced by cloud-5 to a digital audio workstation that
<em>can</em> write soundfiles. The maximum resolution of such soundfiles
is floating-point samples at 48 KHz, significantly higher resolution
than the CD format.</p>
<p>To set this up on the Mac, open the Audio MIDI Setup app, click on
the <code>+</code> at the bottom, and click on Create Multi-Ouput
Device, including both your standard audio output and BlackHole. Then,
in the Sound settings, select that Multi-Output Device as the default
output. Finally, in your DAW or recording software, select BlackHole as
the audio input device.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="extending-cloud-5">Extending cloud-5</h2>
<p>You can extend the capabilities of cloud-5 in several ways,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write user-defined opcodes (UDOs) in Csound that you can
<code>#include</code> in any Csound orchestra.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a custom JavaScript module that you can use in any .html
file.</p></li>
<li><p>Write code in another high-level language and compile it for
WebAssembly, so that it will run in any standards-compliant Web
browser.</p></li>
<li><p>Subclass any of cloud-5&#x2019;s custom HTML elements, or create your
own.</p></li>
<li><p>Adapt for your musical purposes any other software that can run
in a Web browser and be controlled by JavaScript. That covers rather a
lot of ground&#x2026;.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="contributing-to-cloud-5">Contributing to cloud-5</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Enter an issue in the cloud-5 GitHub repository: either a bug, or
a feature request. It should briefly describe what you are going to
contribute.</p></li>
<li><p>Make your own fork of the cloud-5 repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Make any contributions or changes in your fork.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a pull request in your fork. Reference the issue you have
created.</p></li>
<li><p>I will review the pull request, and I will probably merge it if
it does not break existing functionality, is in keeping with the general
objectives of cloud-5, and builds and runs for me.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid introducing new external dependencies as much as possible.
Avoid introducing new programming languages as much as possible. Do not
load dependencies from content distribution networks (CDNs); all
dependendencies used by cloud-5 must be static resources in the cloud-5
directory (obviously, Strudel is a big exception, but I want to keep
that the only one; besides, the build process bundles Strudel into .js
files that <em>are</em> statically served from the cloud-5
directory).</p>
<h2 id="building">Building</h2>
<p>Building cloud-5 is not normally necessary, as pieces will run
directly from the root directory of the system, which is a static Web
site. However, if you plan to make substantial contributions to, or
alterations of, cloud-5, these are the instructions for building.</p>
<p>Install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnpm">pnpm</a>, which
cloud-5 and Strudel use rather than npm. On macOS (I don&#x2019;t know about
other platforms), you may need to specifically install node@18.</p>
<p>To initialize the local repository, obtain dependencies, build a
static Web site, and run it locally, execute the following commands in
the root directory:</p>
<pre><code>cmake .
make</code></pre>
<p>These commands will patch Strudel with my addons; build everything;
and make a distributable copy of the cloud-5 Web site in the
repository&#x2019;s root directory, with all resources statically served.
Examine <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> and <code>package.json</code> for
details.</p>
<p>To test your build, run a local Web server and browse a piece such as
<a
href="http://localhost:8000/cloud_music_no_9.html">cloud_music_no_9</a>,
which uses many facilities of the system.</p>
<p>The build may fail due to failure to build <code>canvas.node</code>
(not actually used here). If that happens, execute
<code>cd cloud-5/strudel/packages/canvas</code> and
<code>node-gyp rebuild</code>, and try again from
<code>pnpm run build</code>.</p>
<p>Before updating Strudel from GitHub, make a branch to contain the
updates if they break cloud-5.</p>
<p>If you see warnings or errors, don&#x2019;t panic unless browsing localhost
does not open a working Web site with playable pieces!</p>
<p>It may be necessary to clear the browser cache and application site
data to see updated pieces.</p>
<p>The <code>csound-wasm</code> and <code>csound-node</code> targets
will rebuild if the upstream Git sources are newer than the local
sources, or if the targets of the build are missing. If you still have
problems with one of these targets, completely delete the problematic
external project source directory, e.g.&#xA0;
<code>rm -rf csound-wasm-prefix/src</code>, delete
<code>CMakeCache.txt</code>, and rebuild.</p>
<p><em><strong>NOTE WELL</strong></em>: The
<code>gogins.github.io</code> repository is maintained using
<code>pnpm run deploy</code> in <em>this</em> <code>cloud-5</code>
repository. <em>DO NOT</em> delete any files from
<code>gogins.github.io</code>, although pieces may be added there. In
other words, <code>gogins.github.io</code> can be the same as, or a
superset of, <code>cloud-5</code>.</p>
<h2 id="running-in-nw.js">Running in NW.js</h2>
<p>It also is possible to run cloud-5 pieces locally in <a
href="https://nwjs.io/">NW.js</a> using <a
href="https://github.com/gogins/csound-extended-node">csound.node</a>.
In this case, csound.node provides a native code build of Csound, and
such pieces can load native code plugins and read and write to the local
filesystem.</p>
<p>This involves installing a number of pre-requisites, but the
advantages include somewhat higher performance from native code Csound,
the ability to use native plugins (both Csound plugin opcodes and VST3
plugins), and the ability to read and write in the local filesystem.</p>
<h3 id="installation-1">Installation</h3>
