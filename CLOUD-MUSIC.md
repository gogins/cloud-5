This is computer music that is hosted online, but actually rendered in Web 
browsers. The pieces are not soundfiles and they are not streamed. Each piece 
is a Web page that contains embedded software that runs in the browser to 
synthesize the music.  Most pieces will play indefinitely. There may or may 
not be animated visuals along with the music. The listener may or may not be 
able to control and/or customize the piece -- perhaps quite a bit, amounting 
to a new piece, co-composed with me.

For more information on most of these pieces, open the piece and view its 
<i><b>About</b></i> tab, or use the browser's inspector to view the underlying 
code.

## Selected Pieces

 - [Scrims](scrims.html), a JavaScript piece that samples an animated WebGL 
   hopalong fractal to obtain notes that are then harmonized using CsoundAC's 
   chord space operations.
 - [Cloud Music No. 1](cloud_music_no_1.html).
 - [Cloud Music No. 2](http://localhost:8000/cloud_music_no_2.html).
 - [Cloud Music No. 3](http://localhost:8000/cloud_music_no_3.html).
 - [Cloud Music No. 4](http://localhost:8000/cloud_music_no_4.html).
 - [Cloud Music No. 6](http://localhost:8000/cloud_music_no_6.html).
 - [Cloud Music No. 8](http://localhost:8000/cloud_music_no_8.html).
 - [Cloud Music No. 9](cloud_music_no_9.html).
 - [Cloud Music No. 14](cloud_music_no_14.html). This one has a button so the 
   user can record a performance and download the resulting soundfile.
 - [2024-ICSC](2024-ICSC.html), prepared for the 2024 International Csound 
   Conference in Vienna. This is the same as Cloud Music No. 14, except that 
   the "Full screen" menu item moves compositional controls onto a 
   second monitor for unobscured visuals.
 - [Cancycle](cancycle.html). Set up to enable live coding.
 - [Polymetric](polymetric.html). 

 ## [cloud-5](https://github.com/gogins/cloud-5)

The cloud-music pieces are (mostly) implemented using my 
[cloud-5](https://github.com/gogins/cloud-5) system for creating computer 
music that runs in Web browsers. 

For more information, including instructions on how to set up the cloud-5 
system and use it for making your own pieces, go to
